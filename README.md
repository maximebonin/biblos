personal library

i already have a working web app to manage one's library of books (or other media), take reading notes and view them

database model won't change 'cause i'm quite happy with it

but the code will be severaly overhauled :

- OOP / MVC architecture

- some kind of ORM or repository that will take care of read/write + integrity management

new features to be added before the app goes live :

- authentication and email password retrieval

- pro-looking css

new features after that : 

- user being able to export and import its data

- easy sharing with colleagues

- adding a book by typing ISBN or taking a pic of the barcode


p.-s. : for obvious reasons do not check-out the code yet !
